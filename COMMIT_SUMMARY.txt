1. Review the changes: git diff --cached
2. Commit documentation: git commit -m "v0.0.2-alpha: Consolidated documentation and improvements"
3. Handle windows-api submodule separately:
   - cd windows-api
   - git add and commit changes
   - cd ..
   - git add windows-api
   - git commit -m "Update windows-api submodule"

READY TO COMMIT!
================
All documentation is now consolidated, clean, and ready to commit.
The README is much more user-friendly and the CHANGELOG provides complete history.
